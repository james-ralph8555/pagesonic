Migration status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: The giant components.css file has been successfully split into modular component files.
- Each component now has its own dedicated CSS file.
- Shared utilities and common patterns are centralized in common.css.
- All imports are properly ordered in index.css to maintain cascade behavior.
- The original components.css file has been removed.

Benefits achieved:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify component-specific styles.
- **Scalability**: New components can get their own CSS files.
- **Development**: Cleaner workflow when working on specific features.
- **Performance**: Better caching and potential for future code splitting.
